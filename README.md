# Electron To-Do App

A simple Electron app built with React. This project helped me understand how the bridge between the app (main process) and UI (renderer process) works.

## Features
âœ… Electron + React UI <br>
âœ… Simple and lightweight <br>
âœ… [Mention what your app does briefly] <br>

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project .
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the app

```bash
  npm run dev
```
## Future Improvements

- [ ] Persistend to-do data
- [ ] macOS/Linux support (Planned) 

Maybe package it for macOS/Linux? ðŸ¤”
